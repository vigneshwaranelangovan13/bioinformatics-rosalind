I used ChatGPT to:

Clarify instructions for the Rosalind problems.

Get example Python code templates for problems (e.g., Counting DNA Nucleotides, GC Content, etc.).

Learn how to use Colab and GitHub (downloading notebooks, uploading to repo, creating release tags).

All final coding, debugging, and submission steps were reviewed and completed by me.
